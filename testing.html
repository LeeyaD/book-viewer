  <h1>Who should use azelaic acid — <a href="#stay_away">and who should not?</a></h1>
    
  <h3>Who could benefit from azelaic acid</h3>
  <p>
    Downie says azelaic acid is "great" for those with combination or oily skin, who are "not so sensitive." She explains that azelaic acid is in class B, meaning it's safe to use during pregnancy or while breastfeeding, but it's still not in class A, aka OTC. She advises women who are pregnant or breastfeeding check with their OBGYN before incorporating azelaic acid into their skin care routine. "I tell people I'm okay with you being on azelaic acid through your pregnancy for acne or your cosmeceutical skin care, as long as your OBGYN is. If they're not, I'm not. And if they are, I am," she says. Downie adds that she "used it (azelaic acid) all through" her pregnancy 17 years ago.

    Maiman agrees, and calls azelaic acid “one of few topicals that is safe for use in both pregnancy and breastfeeding, and is always an ingredient I recommend to women who have childbearing in mind.” She adds it’s “very difficult” for pregnant and breastfeeding women to treat acne and melasma because “a vast majority of treatments dermatologists typically use — both topical and oral — are considered unsafe or lack data necessary to conclude there is no risk to a developing fetus and or infant.”

    Downie says some of her sensitive-skin patients have also experienced stinging, burning and hyperpigmentation, "which is not typical, but it can happen." She notes that hyperpigmentation typically occurs when applying azelaic acid to thinner skin areas near the lips or eyes. Downie suggests that if "you are super sensitive and everything stings, burns and irritates your skin," do a patch test before committing to azelaic acid. Start on the back of your arm and, if there's no reaction, apply it to your neck and your face last.
